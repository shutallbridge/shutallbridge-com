# Overview

Business software has become vital to how modern organizations operate—streamlining operations, scaling workflows, and centralizing data. But users still spend a significant amount of time learning how to use a system, searching for the right screen in a deeply nested dashboard, or filling in repetitive forms--time better spent on thoughtful, strategic work.

Large language models (LLMs) have become more than capable of tackling many of these challenges—understanding intent, extracting structured data, and generating content. Yet they exist as separate chatbots, separate from the workflows where real work happens. The next evolution in human-computer interaction is an interface where humans and AI collaborate directly to get work done.

# Goals

The goal of this project has been to explore the design possibilities and technical feasibility of interfaces built for human-AI collaboration. At a high level, the system aims to:

- Understand user goals and intent based on context
- Adapt the interface dynamically based on users’ goals
- Offload repetitive tasks to AI
- Leverage the complementary strength of both human and AI cognition

# Role and Process

This project began while I was interning as a design engineer at Tofu – an accounting and payroll software company based in Tokyo, Japan. Due to the complexity of the software, customers required extensive onboarding and ongoing support from us.

I was assigned to research and prototype ways to tackle these issues, and worked independently under the supervision of the product manager and the CTO. Along the way, I collaborated with the company’s AI engineer to better understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, which informed the prototype’s technical decisions.

After the internship, I continued developing the concept independently. I realized the challenges of complexity and repetition weren’t unique to payroll—they exist across many business tools. This led to Harper ERP: an open-source, hypothetical ERP system focused on applicant tracking, built as a playground for exploring new patterns in human-AI collaboration.
